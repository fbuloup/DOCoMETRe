 <h1>What is parameters file format ?</h1>
 <p>
 Using parameters in acquisition configuration files is very often a good way to reduce acquisition process files number. Doing so, a set of parameters values will
 be pushed to the real time process before current trial begins. There is also an option to propagate parameters values from a trial to its next one : it can be useful
 if you need to keep and update specific values during all session execution. You can configure parameters in Variables tab of the acquisition configuration file.
 Please keep in mind that his feature is only available with ADwin devices. Once these parameters are configured, you must add a parameters file in the root of each 
 session : it's a simple text file you can manage from DOCoMETRe or create elsewhere. You can see below an example of this kind of file :
 </p>
 <pre>
 paramName1;paramName2;paramName3
 1;5.25;3.28
 0;4.75;3.28
 1;3.25;3.28
 ...
 </pre>
 <p>As you add such a file in each session, you must have at least as many lines as there are trials in the session.
 Here is the content of a blank parameters file which will give more informations on file format, comments and separator char :</p>
 <pre>
# Welcome in this parameters file !
#
# You can use hashtag character (#) to insert comments.
# Everything to the right of this hashtag will be processed as a comment.
#
# Parameters delimiters can be semicolon (;) or comma (,) or colon (:).
#
# Please note that each uncommented line is associated to a trial of the current session, except for the first uncommented line :
# - The first uncommented line will correspond to the parameters names
# - The second uncommented line will correspond to the first trial
# - The third uncommented line will correspond to the second trial
# etc.
#
# Each uncommented line will be parsed to read the parameter name or value.
#
# Here is a parameters file example (the third parameter is of type string) :
# ParameterName1 ; ParameterName2 ; ParameterName3
# 10.25 ; 5 ; condition-1
# -10.25 ; 4 ; condition-2
# 5 ; 3 ; condition-1
# ...
 </pre>
