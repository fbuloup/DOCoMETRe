<title>Data Acquisition</title>

<body>
	<p>The ADWinPro, Arduino or any other real time system, come with their own programming environment. A
		language (ADBasic, C etc.) is used to communicate with the various
		modules installed to acquire and generate signals, as well as for
		real-time processing. It is therefore entirely possible to use this
		language to carry out an experiment.</p>
	<p>However, this kind of language can be difficult to use for people who
		are new to industrial computing and electronics, and costly in terms
		of development time because it has to be reprogrammed for each
		experimental configuration.</p>
	<p>We have therefore developed a software within the laboratory to
		enable all its staff, students, researchers and engineers, to
		configure this acquisition system in the best possible conditions so
		that it best meets their experimental needs. This software enables
		motion to be acquired and possibly disturbed, according to criteria
		defined graphically by the user.</p>
	<p>When using DOCoMETRe, the only principle to bear in mind that
		has a direct link with real time systems (ADwin, Arduino) is the operation of its real-time
		loop. There are then several steps to follow, most of which are taken
		directly from the management of an experimental protocol:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create one or more acquisition configuration files.</li>
			<li>Create one or more acquisition process files. Each of these file must be associated with an acquisition configuration file.</li>
			<li>Organize your experiment : create subjects, sessions and trials. Each trial will run an acquisition process file.</li>
			<li>Run the experiment on a subject or a session</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>With DOCoMETRe you can also inspect acquired signals and even implement data pre-processing such as filtering or point marking in order to extract
	data for statistical analysis. We need finally to add these last step</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Data inspection.</li>
		<li>Data pre-processing and export.</li>
	</ul>
