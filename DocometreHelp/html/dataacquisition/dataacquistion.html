	<p>A real-time system is a system that interacts with an external
		environment that evolves in time: it performs observation and control
		functions. The dynamics of this environment drive the timing
		constraints on the system (latency and response time). The commands
		must ensure the desired behaviour : logical exactitude (they have the
		correct values) and timing exactitude (they are presented at the right
		moment). These commands may depend on the observations and processing.
	</p>
	<p>There are many categories of real-time system. Without going
		into detail, there are synchronous or asynchronous real-time systems
		(Windows can be considered an asynchronous real-time system), strict
		(or hard, which does not tolerate any constraints being exceeded) or
		flexible (soft). Latency corresponds to the system's reaction time and
		response time is the time taken by the system to complete the
		"Observation - Processing - Control" set. This time must be compatible
		with the dynamics of the environment.</p>
	<p>This type of system must therefore be able to observe the
		environment (acquiring information about the state of the environment)
		in order to carry out certain functions in relation to it (disturb it,
		etc.) while complying with time constraints.</p>
	<p>Digital Signal Processor or Microcontroller are typically used
		in real time systems. ADwin products use SHARC DSP family processors
		from Analog Devices or ARM Cortex A9 from Atmel and Arduino Uno uses
		Atmel ATmega328P (release 3) or Renesas RA4M (release 4)
		microcontrollers.</p>
