 <h1>Introduction</h1>

	<p>Data processing can be achieved using DOCoMETRe. It supports
		Matlab or Python engines. With Matlab you should at least have Signal Processing
		toolbox installed and with Python, numpy, scipy and py4j must be
		installed. In Math. Engine preferences, you can configure Matlab and
		Python runtime and user libraries paths and select default math
		engine. Once this configuration is done, you can open the Analyse
		perspective, select the experiment you want to analyse data and load
		subjects from this experiment.</p>

	<p>If there are subjects loaded in Math. engine, you can visualize
		time series from their existing signals but you can also create 2D or
		3D charts. From within DOCoMETRe you should also be able to create and
		configure data processing files. To do so, you can use default
		standard library : it is large enough to handle basic needs (e.g. mean
		and std computations, frequency filtering, points marking or
		data exportation are available). You can also create your own data
		processing functions by extending this standard library. Data
		visualization or data processing on a specific subject is not only
		what you can do in DOCoMETRe : you can apply this visualization or
		process on several subject at a time. It means that you can configure
		a chart on a specific subject and then apply this chart configuration
		on an other loaded subject. It also means that you can tune this data
		processing, elaborate a processing approach on a test subject and
		apply it on several subjects at a time.</p>
