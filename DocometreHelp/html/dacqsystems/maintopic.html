 <h1>Introduction</h1>

For now you can use ADWin and Arduino Uno systems. 
<br><br>
ADWin systems are declined in several hardwares :
<ul>
<li>ADWin Gold</li>
<li>ADWin Gold II</li>
<li>ADWin Pro</li>
<li>ADWin Pro II</li>
</ul>
All these hardwares are supported by DOCoMETRe. 
<br><br>
Note that ADWin systems are mainly available on Windows. They are supposed to work under Linux but 
if you want to use these dacq. systems under Mac OS X, you must install <a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Download">WineHQ</a>. 

<p style="color:rgba(255,0,0,1);"><b>Warning : on Mac OS X, WineHQ is no longer available since Mac OS version 10.15.</b></p>

Arduino Uno R3 and R4 are fully supported on Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. ADS1115 extension module is also supported. 
<br><br>
Support for MCP4725 (DAC 12 bits - I2C) Arduino Uno extension module is planned. Support for Portenta Machine Control or Teensy 4.0 support are also planned.
