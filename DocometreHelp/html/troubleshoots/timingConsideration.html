<h1>General consideration on micro-controllers</h1>

<p>
With Arduino Uno boards up to R3, the default real time loop precision (the <b>loop()</b> method) is not so good because it is software called and because ATMega328 is driven by a ceramic resonator.
Crystal resonators are much more stable and the crystal used on Arduino Uno is for ATMega16 which control USB and ICSP buses [1].
Moreover timing instructions like <b>micros()</b> are not so precise as we could expect because a slow but sure time drift could occur when playing with these instructions. 
Main reason comes from the fact that <b>micros()</b> instruction takes at less 4<span>&#181;</span>s [2]:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4<span>&#181;</span>s with 16MHz Arduino boards </li>
  <li>8<span>&#181;</span>s with 8MHz Arduino boards </li>
</ul>
<p>
These values are not so big but for a long running operation, drift could grow up to more than several milliseconds if timing is based on these instructions.
I've not been able to see any timing drift with ADWin Systems for real time loop running several minutes.
In order to minimize this effect in Docometre with Arduino Uno board up to R3, an interrupt based on timer 1 (16 bits) is used to call a routine for real time loop and timing is computed from the number of this real time loop event : an index is incremented each time the <b>ISR</b> method is called.
Doing so, the only variability comes from the ceramic resonator. If you cannot deal with this, please consider to use Portenta Machine Control or ADWin Systems. Please note that timer 0 is also used to compute CPU workload.
</p>

<p>Another bullet point on microcontrollers without FPU : floating point calculation is emulated [3]. They are not Digital Signal Processors and it is a common practice to avoid floating point calculation in order to increase real time speed capability.
This is the case for Arduino Uno R3 :<br/>
<b>"Floating point math is also much slower than integer math in performing calculations, so should be avoided if, for example, a loop has to run at top speed for a critical timing function. Programmers often go to some lengths to convert floating point calculations to integer math to increase speed."</b>
[4]

This is why you won't find any calibration tools in Docometre when you work with Arduino Uno.
