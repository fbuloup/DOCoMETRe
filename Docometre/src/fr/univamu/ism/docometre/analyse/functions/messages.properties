# The DOCoMETER Software must be used with a real time data acquisition 
# system marketed by ADwin (ADwin Pro and Gold, I and II) or an Arduino 
# Uno. This software, created within the Institute of Movement Sciences, 
# has been developed to facilitate their use by a "neophyte" public in the 
# fields of industrial computing and electronics.  Students, researchers or 
# engineers can configure this acquisition system in the best possible 
# conditions so that it best meets their experimental needs.
