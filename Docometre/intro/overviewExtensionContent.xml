			<text>DOCoMETRe stands for "Dispositif d'Observation et de COntrôle du
				Mouvement En Temps RéEl"</text>
			<text>Its aim is to facilitate data acquisition, real time and deferred data processing in the context of creating a human movement science experiment.</text>
			<text>For data acquisition, this software must be used associated with a hardware coming from JAGER Gmbh (ADwin Pro or Gold) or an Arduino Uno.
			Support for Portenta Machine Control and Teensy 4.0 is planned.</text>
			<text>Can you guess it ? The root concept of this software is the Experiment ! An Experiment is basically a container in DOCoMETRe. 
			So please, start by creating an experiment ! Once you have
			created an experiment, you can add one or more data acquisition configuration.</text> 
			<text>A data acquisition configuration includes not only the physical inputs/outputs used during the experiment 
			but also the variables and the real-time visualization graphs. But now, what do you want to do with this configuration ?</text> 
			<text>For each of these data acquisition configuration, you can associate one or more processes. A process is simply an algorithm which describes 
			the way you want to process inputs, calculate variables and outputs values.</text>
			<text>With data acquisition configurations and processes, you can now create one or more subjects. For each subject you can add one or more sessions, a session
			being a set of trials. Finally, by associating a process to each trial, you can run your experiment with your subjects in order to collect data and answer your 
			experimental question :-) !</text>
			<text>Once data have been acquired, it is possible to run deferred analysis like signal conditioning (e.g. filtering) or points marking and features computation.</text>
			<text>Special thanks to E. ARROU-VIGNOD, Z. MENETRIER, K. PRUD'HOMME and E. VANROME for their contributions to the project.</text>
			<text>I wish also to thanks J. BLOUIN, C. BOURDIN, T. COYLE, F. DANION, J. DE-GRAAF, P. CHAVET, L. MOUCHNINO, V. NOUGIER, R. SALESSE, F. SARLEGNA, J.L. VERCHER and many more
			who have supported and/or contributed to the development of DOCoMETRe.</text>
